# Integration Tests Workflow

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- debug or triage integration test failures
- add or update integration tests
- run integration suites or specific `INT-xxx` tests

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Run integration tests through `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` (not plain `pytest`).
2. Keep tests at HTTP/system boundaries only.
3. Do not mock/patch internals in integration tests (`controller.*`, `worker.*`, `shared.*`).
4. Assert via observable outputs: HTTP responses, logs, DB rows, S3 artifacts, `events.jsonl`.
5. Maintain `INT-xxx` mapping and conventions from `specs/integration-tests.md`.
6. For `build123d` scripts used in tests, ensure every part has `PartMetadata`.
7. Use session IDs in the form `INT-{number}-{uuid8}`.

## System architecture for integration runs

- Infra comes from `docker-compose.test.yaml`: Postgres (`:15432`), MinIO (`:19000`), Temporal (`:17233`).
- Application services run as local Python processes: Controller (`:18000`), Worker Light (`:18001`), Worker Heavy (`:18002`), Temporal worker.
- Frontend tests use a static build served on `:15173` (not dev server).

## Required runner behavior (assume and preserve)

`./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` is the source of truth for orchestration. It:
- sets integration env vars and loads `.env`
- ensures supporting dependencies/services are available
- starts infra containers
- runs migrations
- starts backend processes
- builds/serves frontend when needed
- runs pytest with integration markers
- persists test results and performs cleanup

Do not bypass this runner when executing integration tests.

## Canonical commands

- Full integration suite: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh`
- Marker suite: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh -m integration_p0`
- Single file: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh tests/integration/.../test_file.py`
- Single test: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh tests/integration/.../test_file.py::test_int_020_...`
- Marker expression: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh -m "integration_p0 and not integration_frontend"`
- High-fidelity mode: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --no-smoke`

## Iterative debug directive

- If the user asks to "debug iteratively", run tests and continue debugging/fixing in a loop until the issue is fully resolved (or you hit a hard blocker that requires user input).
- For iterative triage, prefer running with higher failure capture to reduce reruns, e.g. `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --maxfail 10 ...` (or equivalent pytest args passed through the runner).
- For timeout-prone tests, actively inspect logs during execution and terminate early once the root cause is clear (do not wait for full timeout).

**Suggestion**: if a test fails primarily due to long timeout (e.g. 5 minutes), please spare me the time of waiting, and check logs while the test is running. After 30 seconds it would normally already reach its failure point. Again, you can use a subagent.

### Early-stop timeout triage (save time)

Use this workflow when a test is likely to end in a long timeout:

1. Start the narrowest run through the integration runner.
   - Example: `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh tests/integration/...::test_int_xxx --maxfail=1`
2. In parallel, tail service logs while the test is running.
   - `tail -n 200 logs/controller.log`
   - `tail -n 200 logs/worker_light.log`
   - `tail -n 200 logs/worker_heavy.log`
   - `tail -n 200 logs/temporal_worker.log`
3. As soon as failure signature is confirmed (same error path repeating, clear crash, missing artifact gate, etc.), stop the run early.
   - If attached interactively: send `Ctrl-C`.
   - If not attached: terminate the runner process (e.g. `pkill -f run_integration_tests.sh` or kill the specific pytest PID).
4. Immediately capture evidence before rerun:
   - `tail -n 200 logs/integration_tests/full_test_output.log`
   - `tail -n 200 logs/integration_tests/controller.log`
   - `tail -n 200 logs/integration_tests/worker_heavy.log`
5. Apply fix, then rerun the same narrow scope first.

Rules for early termination:
- Only terminate early after you have enough log evidence to identify a concrete failure cause.
- Keep one failing run artifact set (`logs/integration_tests/*`) for traceability before starting the next run.
- Do not switch to plain `pytest`; always rerun via `./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh`.

## Triage procedure

1. Identify failing `INT-xxx` and file/test path from output.
2. Reproduce with the smallest scope through the integration runner.
3. Inspect runtime logs:
   - `tail -100 logs/controller.log`
   - `tail -100 logs/worker_light.log`
   - `tail -100 logs/worker_heavy.log`
   - `tail -100 logs/temporal_worker.log`
   - `tail -100 logs/frontend.log` (frontend tests)
4. Classify failure type (startup/port/schema/simulation/frontend/dependency/migration).
5. Validate behavior through boundaries only (HTTP payloads, logs, DB/S3/events).
6. Implement the smallest fix that preserves system-level behavior.

## Log storage and run history

- Primary current-run logs live in `logs/integration_tests/`. Treat this as the canonical location.
- `logs/controller.log`, `logs/worker_light.log`, `logs/worker_heavy.log`, `logs/temporal_worker.log`, and `logs/frontend.log` are convenience symlinks to files in `logs/integration_tests/`.
- At the start of each integration run, prior `logs/integration_tests/` contents are moved to `logs/archives/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`.
- Old log archives are cleaned automatically (the runner removes `logs/archives/run_*` older than 24 hours).
- Structured test-run summaries are persisted separately under `test_output/`:
  - `test_output/integration_test_history.json` stores recent runs (latest 5)
  - `test_output/integration_test_archive.json` stores older runs
  - `test_output/junit.xml` stores the latest pytest junit output
- Non-mandatory suggestion: when more or less confident about an error case, use a subagent to read logs; it will help you keep your context low. The agent would output the issue causes with exact line evidence.

## Common failure classes

- `Connection refused` on `:18000/:18001/:18002`: service crashed; inspect corresponding log.
- Port in use: stale prior process; terminate stale server processes.
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: request/schema mismatch; confirm current API and migrations.
- Migration failures: DB schema drift; resolve migration state then rerun.
- Simulation timeout: use integration-friendly settings and inspect heavy worker logs.
- Frontend timeout/flakiness: static build/serve issue; inspect `logs/frontend.log`.
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: missing env/dependency activation.
- Teardown failure `Unexpected backend errors/exceptions detected in dedicated service error logs.`: inspect `logs/integration_tests/{controller,worker_light,worker_heavy,temporal_worker}_errors.log`; allow intentional noise with `@pytest.mark.allow_backend_errors` or `BACKEND_ERROR_ALLOWLIST_REGEXES` (`;;`-separated regexes). Strict mode is controlled by `STRICT_BACKEND_ERRORS` (default `1`), and this teardown gate is skipped when the test already failed in call phase.

## Writing/updating integration tests

1. Find the corresponding `INT-xxx` in `specs/integration-tests.md`.
2. Place tests in the right suite:
   - `tests/integration/architecture_p0/`
   - `tests/integration/architecture_p1/`
   - `tests/integration/evals_p2/`
   - `tests/e2e/` for frontend (`integration_frontend`)
3. Backend tests use `httpx.AsyncClient`; frontend tests use Playwright.
4. Use worker/controller endpoints and real payloads, not internal function calls.
5. Keep generous integration timeouts where needed.
6. Re-run targeted test first, then relevant marker suite.

## Common endpoint patterns

- Worker FS: `POST /fs/write`, `POST /fs/read`, `POST /fs/bundle`
- Worker runtime/sim: `POST /runtime/execute`, `POST /benchmark/validate`, `POST /benchmark/simulate`, `POST /benchmark/verify`
- Controller APIs: use public endpoints only for orchestration and event assertions

## Session and metadata conventions

- Session ID format: `INT-{test_number}-{uuid4().hex[:8]}`
- Include `INT-xxx` in test name/docstring.
- In `build123d` scripts used by tests, assign `PartMetadata(...)` to every part.

## Frontend integration specifics

- Frontend URL: `http://localhost:15173`
- Prefer selectors based on stable `data-testid` or explicit UI ids.
- Validate end-to-end behavior against real backend responses, asset fetches, and persisted state.

## Reference files

- `specs/integration-tests.md` (test catalog and INT mapping)
- `specs/frontend-specs.md` (frontend behavior targets)
- `specs/desired_architecture.md` (system behavior source of truth)
- `scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` (execution orchestration)
- `docker-compose.test.yaml` (infra definition)
- `tests/**/conftest.py` (fixtures)
- `references/integration-infra-helpers.md` (integration-only helper files, env toggles, and run artifacts)

## Validation checklist before finishing

- The failing integration test now passes through the integration runner.
- Related tests still pass for the affected area.
- No unit-style mocks leaked into integration tests.
- `INT-xxx` IDs and session naming conventions remain consistent.
