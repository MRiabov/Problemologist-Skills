description: Benchmark execution-review skill for validating implemented benchmarks after validation and simulation. Use when reviewing `benchmark_script.py`, `benchmark_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`, `validation_results.json`, `simulation_result.json`, `scene.json`, render or video evidence, or stage-specific review artifacts; when applying the benchmark execution review checklist for exact inventory grounding, geometry validity, solvability, randomization, and benchmark-side motion; or when writing the `reviews/benchmark-execution-review-*.yaml` pair and submitting via `bash scripts/submit_review.sh`.

# Benchmark Reviewer

Use this skill to decide whether the implemented benchmark is ready to hand off to the engineer graph. Keep the review read-only, evidence-based, and tied to the latest revision.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Confirm the latest revision and valid `.manifests/benchmark_review_manifest.json`.
- [ ] Read `benchmark_script.py`, `benchmark_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`, `plan.md`, `todo.md`, `validation_results.json`, `simulation_result.json`, `scene.json`, `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py`, `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`, and any `renders/benchmark_renders/**` as read-only context.
- [ ] Require validation and simulation success for the latest revision, and confirm `goal_reached` in the manifest/result.
- [ ] Inspect render images with `inspect_media(...)` whenever they exist; if moving benchmark fixtures exist, inspect the latest dynamic simulation evidence before approval.
- [ ] Treat `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py` and `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py` as the inspectable source of the approved benchmark contract.
- [ ] Verify geometric validity, solvability, runtime randomization, exact inventory grounding, and benchmark-side motion against the approved contract and observed evidence. See `references/review_contracts.md`.
- [ ] Reject implementations that rely on free-form XYZ placement instead of selector-driven placement, explicit mates/joints, or the few absolute anchors already fixed by the approved plan.
- [ ] Reject stale or missing validation/simulation evidence, invisible benchmark-side motion, or any benchmark-owned fixture that is silently reinterpreted as engineer-owned work.
- [ ] Keep benchmark-owned source files untouched.
- [ ] Write only `reviews/benchmark-execution-review-decision-round-<n>.yaml` and `reviews/benchmark-execution-review-comments-round-<n>.yaml`.
- [ ] Submit the review with `bash scripts/submit_review.sh` after the files are written.

## Comment Checklist

- [ ] Record the stage evidence fields needed by the reviewer schema, including `latest_revision_verified`, `review_manifest_revision`, `validation_success`, `simulation_success`, `goal_reached`, `solvability_summary`, `attachment_policy_summary`, `render_count`, `inspected_render_count`, `visual_inspection_min_images`, `visual_inspection_satisfied`, `visual_evidence_checked`, `deterministic_error_count`, and `deterministic_refusal_reason` as applicable.
- [ ] Add `dynamic_evidence_checked` or equivalent motion-evidence notes when benchmark-owned motion exists.
- [ ] Keep the summary factual and the required fixes concrete.
