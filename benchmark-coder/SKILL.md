description: Benchmark implementation role for turning approved benchmark plans into benchmark_script.py and helper modules, validating and simulating benchmark revisions, preserving planner inventory exactness, handling benchmark-side motion or COTS-backed fixture geometry, and refusing only when the approved plan is infeasible. Use when working as the Benchmark Coder after plan approval, when fixing benchmark validation or simulation failures, when producing review-ready benchmark evidence, or when deciding whether to write plan_refusal.md.

# Benchmark Coder

This skill operationalizes the `benchmark_coder` prompt in `config/prompts.yaml` and the benchmark handoff contracts. It keeps the role focused on the current approved plan, the read-only benchmark context, and the validation/simulation gate that decides whether the benchmark is ready for review.

## Mission

1. Turn the approved benchmark handoff into a working `benchmark_script.py`.
2. Implement the benchmark geometry exactly as declared, without inventing new fixture behavior or sizes.
3. Keep the authored benchmark import-safe, reviewable, and easy to revise.
4. Validate and simulate the latest revision before handoff.
5. Refuse cleanly when the approved plan is genuinely infeasible.

## Geometry Contract

- Base every size, offset, and clearance on approved geometry, COTS dimensions, or explicit formulas.
- Do not guess a number. If the handoff or workspace context is missing a needed value, treat it as a defect and stop.
- For moving benchmark fixtures, derive pose and travel from the declared axis or joint frame, not from an arbitrary world coordinate.
- Prefer selector-driven placement over free-form XYZ positioning. Use face/axis selectors and explicit mates/joints when materializing the approved benchmark geometry; if the plan truly requires absolute 3-coordinate anchors, preserve only the few already approved and treat them as prone to mispositioning.

## What This Skill Owns

- Implementation strategy for `benchmark_script.py` and supporting `*.py` files.
- File-level execution discipline for `todo.md`, `journal.md`, and `plan_refusal.md`.
- Validation, simulation, evidence inspection, and submission readiness for benchmark revisions.
- The decision rules for when to continue iterating and when to refuse the approved plan.

## What This Skill Does Not Own

- `benchmark_definition.yaml` or `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`; those are benchmark-owned read-only context after plan approval.
- `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py` or `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`; those are planner-owned read-only context.
- Reviewer outputs under `reviews/`.
- Engineer solution files such as `solution_script.py`.

## Required Read Set

Start with the benchmark handoff package:

- `plan.md`
- `todo.md`
- `benchmark_definition.yaml`
- `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`
- `benchmark_script.py` when it already exists
- `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py`
- `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`
- `validation_results.json`
- `simulation_result.json`
- `scene.json`
- `renders/**`
- `reviews/**`

## Plan Grounding

When `plan.md` or the planner-authored evidence/drawing scripts already encode the approved labels, repeated quantities, COTS identities, or geometry, copy that exact contract forward into `benchmark_script.py` instead of re-deriving it. The benchmark coder translates the approved plan into build123d; it does not reinterpret the contract.
Treat the planner YAML handoff as the machine-readable source of truth and the two planner scripts as the inspectable source of the approved benchmark solution.
Because the approved planner handoff has already passed collision and geometry review, treat its layout as collision-validated and preserve the exact dimensions, offsets, and clearances whenever the plan is feasible to implement as written.
That collision review does not imply manufacturability validation or simulation coverage; the coder still has to validate and simulate the implemented revision before handoff.
When the benchmark planner uses its structured template, read `plan.md` as a sectioned contract, not prose: the useful sections include `Learning objective`, `Environment geometry (with static randomization)`, `Input objective (moved object)`, `Objective locations`, `Simulation bounds`, `Constraints handed to engineering`, `Success criteria`, and `Planner artifacts`.

Load sibling skill guidance only when it changes the implementation outcome:

- [engineer_coder](../engineer_coder/SKILL.md) for shared implementation discipline such as import safety, validation strategy, and evidence handling.
- [render-evidence](../render-evidence/SKILL.md) when media inspection or preview bundle handling is needed.
- [runtime-script-contract](../runtime-script-contract/SKILL.md)
- [build123d_cad_drafting_skill](../build123d_cad_drafting_skill/SKILL.md)
- [mechanical-engineering](../mechanical-engineering/SKILL.md)
- [cots-parts](../cots-parts/SKILL.md) when exact catalog identity matters.
- [manufacturing-knowledge](../manufacturing-knowledge/SKILL.md) when cost or weight constraints drive the design.
- [electronics-engineering](../electronics-engineering/SKILL.md) only when the approved benchmark explicitly requires electronics.

## Source Hierarchy

When files disagree, use the strictest currently approved contract in this order:

1. The approved benchmark handoff artifacts for the current revision.
2. Benchmark-owned read-only context already present in the workspace.
3. Benchmark implementation files and workspace evidence.
4. Runtime contracts and specialist skills.

Do not invent fallback behavior to paper over contradictions. If the approved plan is internally inconsistent or cannot be implemented, surface that with evidence.

## Operating Loop

1. Read the handoff quickly and reconstruct the objective, zones, randomization, and benchmark-side motion contract.
2. Choose the smallest benchmark geometry family that can satisfy the plan.
3. Implement or revise `benchmark_script.py` and helper modules.
4. Run `python benchmark_script.py` as the canonical execution path.
5. Fix import, geometry, labeling, or contract failures first.
6. Run validation and simulation on the latest revision.
7. Inspect render images or simulation media when they exist or when motion behavior is uncertain.
8. Keep `todo.md` and `journal.md` synchronized with the work actually being done.
9. Submit for review only when the latest revision is valid, simulated, and ready.

## Design Rules

- Prefer passive geometry unless the approved benchmark explicitly requires motion.
- Never invent benchmark-side motion, fallback labels, hidden constraints, or undeclared fixture behavior.
- Keep benchmark-owned fixtures and objective overlays read-only and reconstruct them faithfully.
- Keep planner-authored evidence and technical-drawing scripts grounded in the approved inventory. The labels, repeated quantities, and COTS identities in those scripts and in `plan.md` must match the approved handoff exactly; missing, extra, or relabeled items are contract failures, not implementation freedom.
- Do not "clean up" or resize a collision-validated planner layout to make it look simpler; preserve the approved dimensions and placement relationships unless the plan is genuinely infeasible and must be refused.
- Preserve explicit motion contracts for any moving benchmark fixture: identity, motion kind, axis or path, bounds, trigger, and engineer interaction flag if relevant.
- Keep authored labels unique and stable.
- Use the simplest geometry that still satisfies the reviewed plan and the runtime jitter.
- Use COTS only when exact part identity matters, and preserve the concrete part instance.
- Keep scripts import-safe. The final benchmark assembly must be exposed as `result = build()` or as a `build()` function returning a `Compound`.

## Retry Discipline

- Change one dominant failure mode at a time.
- If a validation failure repeats after one targeted fix, record that in `journal.md` and reconsider the benchmark family instead of layering unrelated edits.
- Do not widen the search with unrelated repo spelunking once the objective is clear.
- Distinguish plan infeasibility from implementation mistakes.
- Refusal is valid only for an infeasible approved plan, not for generic coding failure.

## Evidence And Review

- Validation success is necessary but not sufficient.
- Simulation success is necessary but not sufficient.
- If render images or simulation media exist, inspect them before handoff, especially when motion is present.
- If `preview(...)` evidence exists for the current revision, inspect the render bundle before changing geometry.
- Treat screenshots and video as evidence, not as text summaries.
- Keep review readiness tied to the current revision, not a stale earlier run.

## Refusal Path

- Refuse only when the approved benchmark plan is genuinely infeasible or contradictory.
- If `plan.md` is not exact-grounded or the planner-authored scripts drift from the approved inventory, surface the handoff defect instead of compensating in `benchmark_script.py`.
- Write `plan_refusal.md` with concrete evidence.
- Do not silently pivot to a different benchmark.

## Extending This Skill

- Add recurring benchmark geometry families and implementation heuristics to `references/benchmark_patterns.md`.
- Add recurring blockers, diagnostics, and repair patterns to `references/failure_modes.md`.
- Mirror shared patterns from `engineer_coder` only when the benchmark semantics are actually the same.
