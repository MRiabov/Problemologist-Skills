description: Benchmark planning and handoff authoring for Problemologist. Use when creating or revising benchmark planner artifacts (`plan.md`, `todo.md`, `benchmark_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py`, `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`), checking benchmark solvability or randomization, defining benchmark-owned fixture motion, reviewing planner drafting output with `preview_drawing()`, enforcing exact-grounded inventory mentions, or preparing the plan for `submit_plan()`.

# Benchmark Planner

Turn a benchmark brief into a complete handoff that the benchmark coder can implement without re-planning.

## Mission

1. Define one clear learning objective and the smallest benchmark that teaches it.
2. Keep the benchmark solvable, internally consistent, and easy for downstream roles to consume.
3. Prefer passive geometry first. Add benchmark-owned motion only when it is necessary for the objective.
4. Fail closed when required benchmark facts are missing, contradictory, or hidden behind placeholders.

## Geometry Contract

- Base every size, offset, and clearance on declared geometry, COTS dimensions, or an explicit formula.
- Do not guess a number. If the handoff is missing a needed value, treat the draft as incomplete instead of inventing one.
- When a fixture moves, derive its pose from the declared axis or joint frame instead of a world-coordinate guess.
- Prefer selector-driven placement over free-form XYZ positioning. Use face/axis selectors and explicit mates/joints to constrain parts to each other and to the environment; if an absolute 3-coordinate anchor is unavoidable, keep it to one or two top-level placements at most and treat it as fragile.
- Treat the planner handoff as YAML-backed: `benchmark_definition.yaml` and `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml` are the machine-readable contract, while `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py` and `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py` are the inspectable source of the approved geometry.

## Read First

Read these before drafting or revising the handoff:

- `references/handoff_contract.md`
- `specs/desired_architecture.md`
- `config/prompts.yaml`
- `specs/architecture/agents/roles.md`
- `specs/architecture/agents/handover-contracts.md`
- `specs/architecture/agents/artifacts-and-filesystem.md`
- `../engineer_coder/SKILL.md`
- `../build123d_cad_drafting_skill/SKILL.md`
- `../render-evidence/SKILL.md` when render evidence already exists or preview judgment is needed
- `../mechanical-engineering/SKILL.md` when geometry or motion needs mechanical reasoning
- `../cots-parts/SKILL.md` when a benchmark-owned fixture uses a catalog-backed component
- `../manufacturing-knowledge/SKILL.md` when explicit cost or quantity reasoning matters

## Working Rules

01. Design the benchmark for the engineer, not the solution.
02. Keep the challenge singular: one objective, one failure mode, one obvious path to success.
03. Keep `benchmark_definition.yaml` as the source of truth for objective geometry, randomization, and benchmark estimates.
04. Keep `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml` as benchmark-owned fixture structure and motion contract.
05. Keep `plan.md`, `todo.md`, the YAML files, and both benchmark planning scripts mutually consistent.
06. Do not expect `benchmark_script.py` in the planner workspace before plan approval.
07. Treat benchmark-owned fixtures as downstream read-only context. Do not drift into engineer solution design.
08. Preserve exact part identity when a benchmark fixture is catalog-backed. Do not replace it with anonymous solids.
09. Use reserved names carefully: top-level authored labels must be unique and must not be `environment` or start with `zone_`.
10. Do not invent fallback labels, placeholder fields, or silent defaults to make a draft pass.

## Planner Loop

1. Reconstruct the objective, build zone, forbid zones, runtime jitter, and any benchmark-owned fixtures.
2. Choose the simplest benchmark family that still teaches the intended behavior.
3. Draft the benchmark geometry and any benchmark-owned fixture motion with explicit limits and clear visibility in the handoff.
4. Write `plan.md`, `todo.md`, `benchmark_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_assembly_definition.yaml`, `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py`, and `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py`.
5. Cross-check labels, AABBs, motion, and script geometry against the YAML before submission.
6. Call `submit_plan()` only after the handoff is coherent and placeholder-free.

## Handoff Rules

- Keep `plan.md` narrative-first and specific enough that the benchmark coder can implement without re-deciding the benchmark shape.
- Keep `todo.md` actionable and ordered for the benchmark coder.
- Keep `benchmark_plan_evidence_script.py` and `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py` aligned with the same geometry, labels, repeated quantities, and COTS identities as the approved inventory, and ensure every planner-declared inventory label and selected COTS `part_id` appears in `plan.md` at least once as an exact identifier mention.
- Treat `benchmark_plan_technical_drawing_script.py` as display-only: it should not re-author a duplicate shape tree or a second copy of the benchmark geometry, only the orthographic drawing/view scaffolding for the same approved contract.
- Keep every dimension formula-backed; if the handoff is missing a needed length, thickness, clearance, or placement datum, fix the source rather than guessing.
- Use `preview(...)` for live scene previews and `preview_drawing()` for drafting packages; they are not interchangeable.
- When drawings are part of the handoff, inspect the drafted package with `preview_drawing()` before `submit_plan()`.
- Make the benchmark-owned motion contract explicit if any fixture moves. In this repo, keep each moving fixture to one explicit DOF axis and spell out the controller facts and limits.
- Keep the moved object inside `build_zone` under static variation plus runtime jitter.
- Keep goal and forbid zones non-overlapping with the moved object at spawn.
- Treat `submit_plan()` as the final gate, not as a shortcut around an incomplete handoff.

## Common Failure Modes

- Goal or forbid zones overlap the moved object path.
- Runtime AABB escapes the build zone.
- Labels collide with reserved names or with each other.
- The inventory is only semantically similar, not exact, across `plan.md`, the YAML, and the planner scripts.
- A moving benchmark fixture is implied but not declared clearly.
- The evidence script drifts from the YAML geometry.
- The handoff assumes a downstream file that does not exist yet.
- The draft still contains placeholders, invented defaults, or ambiguous ownership.

## Boundary With Engineer Coder

Write the benchmark so `../engineer_coder/SKILL.md` can consume it as clean read-only context. If the downstream engineer would need to guess the benchmark intent, tighten the plan instead of handing off ambiguity.
